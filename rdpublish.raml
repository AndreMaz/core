  - title: OIC Rsource Directory
    content: |
      A Resoure Directory is an OIC Device that helps other OIC Devices to be discovered.
  - title: Introduction
    content: |
      For resource in other OIC Devices to be discovered using the Resource Directory, these other devices have to publish the resource links they would otherwise have advertised through /oic/res to the Resource Directory. Once the information has been published then the OIC Devices may stop responding to discovery queries and may also go to sleep.

      The Resource Directory will respond to all discovery queries with resources that it directly advertises and also the resource information that has been published to it.
  - title: Resource Directory discovery
    content: |
      Before an OIC Device publishes its resource information, it must first discover available Resource Directories and then select one of those to publish the information to.

      This doscovery is done with a multicast query to /oic/rd. The information returned is either a bais factor or a list of attributes that help the discovering OIC Device to select one of the RDs. This RD will be used till the RD does not respond or another RD is selected.
  - title: Resource Directory publish
    content: |
      Once the RD has been discovery and selected, the OIC Device can publish its resoure information. The resource information are published to the /oic/rd resource using the "publish" interface. The information that needs to tbe available in /oic/res is then populated by the Resource Directory.

      Periodically based on the TTL set by the publishing OIC Device, the information that is published has to be refreshed with a new TTL or the TTL can be updated if there is no change in the information. It is the responsibility of the publishing OIC Device to ensure that the information or TTL is updated before the previous TTL expires; failing this the RD will garbage collect all the information related to the publishing OIC Device.
  - title: Resource discovery
    content: |
      The discovery of resources is done in the same manner as for any OIC Server. A query to /oic/res either over multicast or uincast is required.
